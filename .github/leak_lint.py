"""leak-lint — fail the build if internal workflow text reaches this public repo.

This repo is donation-intended and public. It must not carry the ids, vocabulary or paths of
the private workspace that produces it: to an outside contributor or downstream adopter, that
reads as the "neutral" repo being steered from somewhere they cannot see.

Two kinds of rule:

  1. **Bracketed internal ids (public rule, always on)** -- `[` + 3-or-more hyphen-separated
     lowercase-alnum segments + `]`, e.g. `[some-internal-task-id]`. Generic, so it lives here.
     The 3-segment floor excludes TOML table headers (`[build-system]`) and the lowercase-only
     class excludes citation tags (`[RFC2119]`). Markdown links, reference links, pip extras
     and HTML attribute selectors are excluded by what surrounds the bracket (see
     `_has_bracket_id_leak`).
  2. **Term classes (from a secret)** -- literal substrings grouped into named classes. The
     list is deliberately NOT stored in this repository: a public gate that enumerated the
     terms would itself publish them. It is supplied at run time in the ``LEAK_LINT_TERMS``
     environment variable (a repository secret in CI), as a JSON object mapping a class name
     to its terms, e.g. ``{"class-a": ["term", ...], "class-b": [...]}``. Matching is
     case-sensitive.

Fail-closed: if ``LEAK_LINT_TERMS`` is unset, empty, malformed or carries no terms, the lint
exits 2 rather than passing on the public rule alone -- a missing list must never read as
"clean".

Output redaction (same model as the sibling ``neutrality_scan.py``): unless
``LEAK_LINT_REVEAL`` is truthy, a run on which any term matched prints one constant verdict --
no path, line, class or count -- because on a fork run the scanned content is the submitter's,
and detailed output would reveal which candidate matched. The public pass/fail result
still reveals whether a candidate string matches any term; redaction does not hide membership. Bracketed-id hits carry nothing secret and are
printed in full, but only when no term matched anywhere (otherwise which lines are printed
would itself be the oracle).

Design:
  - **Exact-text allowlist**, `leak_lint_allowlist.txt` next to this script, for genuine
    historical record, loaded from the trusted scanner checkout, never the scanned PR. Never line numbers -- the exact stripped line text.
  - **Scans generated artifacts too** (`.txt`, `.xml`), not just sources.
  - **Lockfile URL and hash values are not term-matched** (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`,
    `pnpm-lock.yaml`) when they are what a public registry or a hash looks like: an https URL
    on a host in `PUBLIC_REGISTRY_HOSTS` (its #fragment is still matched), an SRI integrity
    value whose digest is its algorithm's length, a hex checksum. A URL on any other host, or
    a file:, git+ssh:, link: or workspace: value, is matched as usual, and so is the rest of a
    lockfile (see `exempt_remainder`).
  - **Excludes this script, its allowlist, its CI workflow and its tests by filename.**
  - **Scans the COMMITTED tree** (`git ls-files -z`) of ROOT, and never follows a symbolic link
    or reads outside ROOT: on a fork run ROOT is untrusted content.

Usage: python leak_lint.py [ROOT=.]
Exit 0 = clean; 1 = leak(s) found; 2 = misconfiguration (no term list).
