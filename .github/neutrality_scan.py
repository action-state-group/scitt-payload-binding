"""Neutrality gate — fail the build if reserved vocabulary appears in this repo.

This repository is a neutral public surface (the agentactioncapsule.org standard
site for the Agent Action Capsule specification). A small set of concepts is reserved
and must not appear here. The reserved list is deliberately NOT stored in this
repository — a public gate that enumerated the terms would itself disclose them.
Instead the list is supplied at run time via the ``NEUTRALITY_TERMS`` repository
secret, and this script is pure matching logic parameterized by that secret.

Fail-closed: if the secret is absent/empty the gate errors (exit 2) rather than
passing silently — a missing list must never read as "clean".

Secret schema (JSON):
    {"substring": [...], "word": [...], "allow_phrases": [...]}
  - substring   : matched case-insensitively anywhere
  - word        : matched case-insensitively at word boundaries (low-collision
                  short names that must not false-positive inside other words)
  - allow_phrases: already-public sentences that legitimately carry a token; a
                  match is exempt ONLY when it falls inside the span of such a
                  phrase on the same line — not every occurrence of the token on
                  the line (two-occurrence fix: track spans, not just presence).

Usage: python .github/neutrality_scan.py [ROOT=.]
       python .github/neutrality_scan.py --self-test
Exit 0 = clean; 1 = reserved vocabulary found (prints file:line); 2 = misconfig.
